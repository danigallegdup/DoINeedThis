That sounds like a fantastic idea! We can turn this prototype into a simulated PC environment where users can:

Test different features of your prototype (e.g., the Chrome extension and mobile app).
Showcase interactions in a realistic desktop setting with windows, icons, and draggable/resizable elements.
Create a dynamic UI that mimics a PC with a taskbar, openable apps, and toggling between experiences.
Plan
Desktop Environment:

A taskbar at the bottom with an interactive start menu.
Icons representing the Chrome extension, phone app, and other demos.
Multiple openable/resizable windows (fake browser, phone emulator, and settings panel).
Fake Browser (Chrome Extension Simulation):

Retains your current design.
Tab switching, extensions, and notifications.
Phone Emulator (Mobile App Simulation):

A floating iPhone/Android phone frame where users can interact with the app.
Touch gestures simulated via mouse.
Extra Cool Features:

Dark mode toggle.
Draggable windows and resizable elements.
System notifications.
Live tracking of user interactions.
Next Steps
I'll start by setting up the basic desktop environment, and then we can expand it with the features you need. Let me know if you want any specific design choices! ðŸš€
